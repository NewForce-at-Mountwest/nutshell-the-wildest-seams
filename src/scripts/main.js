// edit button steps - takes three fetch calls
// select edit the edit button - fetch that "get" objects data
// edit button needs some dashes. you need an id
// need an event listener on that button
// form pops up with the values in it
// fetch the values from the database and put them in the inputs
// save button with the same id
// make changes
// build an edited object with the new values and make sure that the ID is in there
// we need to have a save button that puts to json - fetch put ?put is already in database but changes it
// then we need to clear the field and print everything again - fetch get
//
